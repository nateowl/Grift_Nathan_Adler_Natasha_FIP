              <li>STEP 1: MILLING different types of malt crushed together to break up grain kernels to extract fermentable sugars to produce milled product called grist.</li>
              <li>STEP 2: MASHING the grit is then mixed with heated water to create a process where natural enzymes in the malt break the malt startch down into sugars.</li>
              <li>STEP 3: BREW KETTLE a sweet liquid (known as wort) is separated from the grain husks and is s brought to a controlled boil before the hops are added.</li>
              <li>STEP 4: COOLING During this stage, any malt or hop particles are removed to leave a liquid that is ready to be cooled and fermented.</li>

              <li>STEP 6: BEACHWOOD LAGERING For more than a century we have maintained old-world brewing techniques like “krausening” to heighten natural carbonation, and remain the only major brewer to use beechwood chips for aging.</li>
              <li>STEP 7: FILTRATION After reaching its full potential, the beer is filtered, leaving no excess materials and ingredients behind, leaving a full body liquid.</li>
              <li>STEP 8: CARBONATION The beer goes through a cellaring process, taking 3-4 weeks to complete. Then it is ready to be bottled up & shipped world wide.</li>
